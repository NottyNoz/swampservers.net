<h2>Why we don't have a Discord guild...</h2>

<p>
tl;dr:
<ul>
<li>Discord considers the phrase "<strong>child molestors should be chemically castrated</strong>" to be in violation of their ToS. So, Discord actively protects the groomers and pedophiles their platform is notorious for having.</li>
<li>Discord bans guild owners' personal accounts for offenses committed by their members, and yet, they refuse to provide information beyond their vague ToS about what does and does not constitute a violation.</li>
<li>In effect: <strong>Discord forces one to actively protect child predators in order to operate a guild on their platform</strong>, which we refuse to do.</li>
</ul>

The rant above was posted after the latest in a series of takedowns inflicted on us by Discord.
</p>

<p>Now here is the full story:</p>

<hr>

<p>
Swamp Servers, a Garry's Mod gaming community, is a relic of the time when the internet used to be free.
Within the game, I allow our users to say basically whatever they want short of calling for violence or extreme edgyness, so our users tend to have a very "libertarian" view of what they presume to be allowed.
This has made it difficult to operate a Discord guild, as in my experience Discord's policy is that whenever someone says something in violation of Discord's ToS,
they not only take action against that user, but they also take action against the guild they posted in and that guild owner's account.
</p>

<p>
We've had our guild taken down several times, and after the first time I lost my personal account because of what someone else said, I wisened up and started using alt accounts to make the new guilds.
Every time the guild is removed, so is the owner's account. When the takedown occurs, I get an email like this:
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
This is hilarious because these emails are going to the alternate accounts that I use to make new guilds.
<em>The accounts which are recieving this and being terminated have literally never posted a single message on Discord.</em>
</p>

<hr>
<p>
We quickly figured out that Discord expects us to enforce their ToS for them, and that a failure to do their jobs for them is itself a bannable offense.
</p>
<p>
However, the vagueness of their community guidelines made it difficult to do this and we continued to suffer takedowns.
They absolutely refused to give a more specific reason than "bullying" or "dehumanizing" for any of our takedowns, but we figured out that whenever the server got banned they would also ban
the account of whoever posted the message that got us banned, so we were able to somewhat narrow things down by figuring out what that person had recently posted.
</p>

<p>
We very quickly disallowed "edgy" posts but continued to suffer repeated takedowns, which is frustrating because some of the kind of content we prohibited is easily discoverable on other Discord guilds.
We suspect someone has been obsessively reporting every controversial message in our guild, and what this means is that <strong>any non-partnered guild and its owner is vulnerable to being terminated</strong> if someone simply obsessively reports every remotely offensive message (likely from different source IPs/accounts).
Moderation has to be both very strict, and active 24/7 (as Discord sometimes takes less than an hour to act on reports), or the guild and owner's personal account are vulnerable to being randomly terminated.
</p>
<hr>
<p>
For the last few months we operated a guild in which we were not allowing any slurs whatsoever, any memes about or negative discussions of race/religion/LGBTQ whatsoever, or any
discussions of other guilds (as this may lead to raiding), yet we still got taken down again. We investigated, caught one of our players talking to his friend on GMod about how his Discord account was banned at the same time as our guild, and asked him what he had posted on our guild.
He reported that the only remotely offensive thing he did was talk about <em>court-ordered chemical castration of child molestors</em>, which presumably, our moderators did not see a problem with, nor should they have.
</p>
todo: put evidence here
<hr>
<p>
It is absurd enough that Discord, unlike any other social media platform, expects us to enforce their rules for them and punishes us personally if we don't do it to their liking, despite our honest efforts.
</p>
<p>
It is absurd enough that they refuse to give anything other than extremely vague information about what we are expected to enforce, which is again unlike most social media platforms, where you're given an indication of which video or tweet it was that you posted violated the ToS.
</p>
<p>
But now, <strong>Discord is requiring guild owners to PROTECT CHILD MOLESTORS</strong> and banned our guild because we were not doing a good enough job of it!
</p>

<p>
I got fed up with the absurdity of all this and posted the rant shown above on my other, read-only Discord server. After the rant above, I later posted this:
</p>

<p>

<img src="r4.png">
</p>

<p>
It may not be surprising to hear that my actual personal account (not just the alternate account used to make a server) was terminated immediately after this (for "dehumanizing"),
but I actually did not expect them to do that. Once again, other social media websites (youtube, twitter etc) are full of people complaining about website policy and insulting and calling out
the company in a similar manner which never get taken down in retaliation. So either Discord T&S is run by a bunch of overgrown toddlers, who simply made up a reason to axe me because I insulted them, or they actually banned me for this particular message:

<p>Either way, Discord can go to hell. Steam is my new best friend.</p>

Although our size is nothing compared to Discord, we are still one of the <a href="https://www.gametracker.com/search/garrysmod/">top Garry's Mod servers in the world</a>, so we hope this statement carries some level of legitimacy.
</p>
<p>
None of the content on this page constitues libel.
We sincerely believe these claims to be true, have shown good evidence for them, and we have made numerous attempts to reach out to Discord about this through many different channels, none of which garnered a substantive response from them.
We feel that if these claims were false, Discord would have responded at least once to deny them.
