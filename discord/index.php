<h1>We use <a href="https://s.team/chat/LzFgkFD4">Steam Chat</a> instead of Discord.<br>&nbsp;</h1>

<p>We do have a Discord guild as well, but we only use it for voice/video chat. The link can be found in the "VOICE" section of our Steam Chat.<br>&nbsp;</p>

<p>The reason we avoid Discord is because of their <a href="/discordmoderators">endless unreasonable takedowns</a> of our accounts and groups.<br>&nbsp;</p>
