		<h3 class="text-center">With power, comes responsibility</h3>
		<p class="text-center">
			<strong>It is crucially important for this server to not feel like staff members are abusive.</strong><br>If you are found to be abusing power, you might be banned from the server entirely.
		</p>

		<p class="text-center">
			<strong>Please become deeply familiar with the <a href="/rules">Rules.</a><br>Always interpret the rules exactly as they are written, like a law.</strong>
		</p>


		<h3 class="text-center">Conduct</h3>



		<ul class="bb_ul">
			<li>
			As a staff member, you do represent the server and players will inevitably look up to you.
			With your position, set a decent example by <strong>not needlessly picking fights, acting toxic, obnoxiously edgy/racist, talking down to people, or otherwise antagonizing people unnecessarily.</strong>
			When you, as a staff member, antagonize a player, they might feel like they can't fight you back or you would ban them because that's how most servers are (even though we're not actually like that).
			<strong>Use common sense with your position of power and understand that your conduct is more limited than a typical player.</strong>
			If you have any doubts on what behavior might be limited, ask a higher-up.
			</li>
			<li>Staff do not get any special permissions outside of kick, ban, and unban. You cannot spawn in weapons, no-clip, or force skip videos for no reason. If you want to "admin abuse," go to a different community.</li>
			<li>If you have any questions, please ask other staff members or in staff chat in-game or in our Steam group chat.</li>
			<li>Do not leak information from our private chat group or from any staff-only webpage. Access to staff webpages (eg. ban manager) is logged and can be audited.
				<strong>Leaking of confidential staff information will result in an automatic demotion and possibly a ban.</strong>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="text-center">Tools</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>DO NOT use any staff powers such as kick/ban or force-skipping videos unless a rule violation has occured! All staff actions must be justified!</strong></li>
			<li>To perform actions such as kick, ban, type "sc.menu" in console or say "!menu" in chat.</li>
			<li>Screengrab can be used to find wall hackers.</li>
			<li>AFKmonitor can be used to find AFK evasion scripts (Do not ban for this; let console do it).</li>
			<li>Use the <a href="/log-viewer">Log viewer</a> to investigate reports if you have permission (otherwise, ask someone else to use it for you).</li>
			<li>Use the <a href="/bans">Ban manager</a> to edit bans or check for past bans if you have permission (otherwise, ask someone else to use it for you).</li>
			<li>To chat privately with other staff in-game, use the <em>/sc &lt;message&gt;</em> chat command.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="text-center">Ban Lengths</h3>
		<p>
			If the user has <strong>no previous bans</strong> and:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Shares a video as described by the "edgy content" rule which is <strong>publicly viewable on YouTube</strong></li>
			<li>Asks FEDORA-BOT for "edgy content"</li>
			<li>Runs a spam macro</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			They shall be banned for 5 minutes. If they are offline, they'll still see the message upon rejoining later.
		</p>
		<p>
			In most other situations, the question of whether to kick, temp-ban, or permaban depends on the situation, and we trust you to make a fair decision. 
			Ask other staff if you need help making a decision.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the case of apparent child pornography, we have specific guidelines. First of all, there are two types of "child pornography":
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>REAL child pornography</strong> is actual photographic images or video of underage humans engaged in sex.</li>
			<li><em>Pseudo child pornography</em> consists of anything which sexualizes children without falling into the above category. For example: Jailbait, lolicon, and underage nudism. This is not illegal but it is against our rules.
		</ul>
		<p>
			If someone shares <strong>REAL child pornography</strong>, we must comply with <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2258A" target="_blank">U.S. Code ยง 2258A.</a> Follow these steps:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Take a screenshot of the apparent CP. This is an important part of the report, and if you delete the image once you're done with it, then you aren't doing anything wrong.</li>
			<li>Permaban the user and any "accomplices"</li>
			<li>Tell <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037111412" target="_blank">Swamp</a> about this incident, and he will give directions to securely upload the screenshot. Swamp will then use the screenshot, and other info from the server logs, to create and send a report to the NCMEC's CyberTipline.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="text-center">Ban Appeals</h3>
		<p>
			Except in extreme cases (doxxing, ddosing, etc.), if a user is banned for their first offense, and they create a reasonable appeal, the ban should be removed immediately.
			It takes a decent amount of work to make a ban appeal. There is no reason to be overly punitive.
		</p>

	<h3 class="text-center">The Movie Theater</h3>
	<p>The Movie Theater is a staff-controllable theater meant for watching movies, TV shows, or major events.  As a staff member, anything you play will not be covered by the Explicit Video Warning. As a result, playing pornography in here is not allowed. Additionally, you have the ability to force skip and seek in it. Please do not "troll" with these commands and only use them to play legitimate movies, shows, or major event livestreams.</p>

	<h3 class="text-center">Movie Nights</h3>
	<p>Any staff member can host <strong>movie nights</strong>. To do so, request a movie into the Movie Theater and then say <em>!movienight &lt;title of movie&gt;</em> in chat. This will make a server-wide announcement and lock the Movie Theater queue, and your movie will play after a 5 minute timer.</p>

	<p>If you plan on hosting movie nights or events, you get a rank on the Steam group which allows you mention users in the Steam chat to attract more players to your event.</p>

	<p><em>Movies can be found under the Lookmovie.io link under "Request Video". You can also ask for access to the Neko instance and the Plex login if you plan on hosting movie nights.</em></p>

	<h3 class="text-center">Requirements</h3>
	<p>At a minimum, please be active on a weekly basis. If you disappear for a few weeks without notice, you will be demoted.</p>
