		<h3 class="text-center">With power, comes responsibility</h3>
		<p class="text-center">
			<strong>It is crucially important for this server to not feel like staff members are abusive.</strong><br>If you are found to be abusing power, you might be banned from the server entirely.
		</p>

		<p class="text-center">
			<strong>Please become deeply familiar with the <a href="/rules">Rules.</a><br>Always interpret the rules exactly as they are written, like a law.</strong>
		</p>


		<h3 class="text-center">Conduct</h3>



		<ul class="bb_ul">
			<li>
			As a staff member, you do represent the server and players will inevitably look up to you.
			With your position, set a decent example by <strong>not needlessly picking fights, acting toxic, obnoxiously edgy/racist, talking down to people, or otherwise antagonizing people unnecessarily.</strong>
			When you, as a staff member, antagonize a player, they might feel like they can't fight you back or you would ban them because that's how most servers are (even though we're not actually like that).
			<strong>Use common sense with your position of power and understand that your conduct is more limited than a typical player.</strong>
			If you have any doubts on what behavior might be limited, ask a higher-up.
			</li>
			<li>Staff do not get any special permissions outside of kick, ban, and unban. You cannot spawn in weapons, no-clip, or force skip videos for no reason. If you want to "admin abuse," go to a different community.</li>
			<li>If you have any questions, please ask other staff members in staff chat in-game or in our Steam group chat.</li>
			<li>Do not leak information from our private chat group or from any staff-only webpage. Access to staff webpages (eg. ban manager) is logged and can be audited.
				<strong>Leaking of confidential staff information will result in an automatic demotion and possibly a ban.</strong>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 class="text-center">Tools</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>DO NOT use any staff powers such as kick/ban or force-skipping videos unless a rule violation has occured! All staff actions must be justified!</strong></li>
			<li>To perform actions such as kick, ban, type "sc.menu" in console or say "!menu" in chat.</li>
			<li>Screengrab can be used to find wall hackers.</li>
			<li>AFKmonitor can be used to find AFK evasion scripts (Do not ban for this; let console do it).</li>
			<li>Use the <a href="/log-viewer">Log viewer</a> to investigate reports if you have permission (otherwise, ask someone else to use it for you).</li>
			<li>Use the <a href="/bans">Ban manager</a> to edit bans or check for past bans if you have permission (otherwise, ask someone else to use it for you).</li>
			<li>To chat privately with other staff in-game, use the <em>/sc &lt;message&gt;</em> chat command.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="text-center">Ban Lengths</h3>
		<p>
			The question of whether to kick, temp-ban, or permaban depends on the situation, and we trust you to make a fair decision. 
			Try to consider the apparent malice behind a user's actions when determining a ban length.
			Minor accidental offenses (eg. someone doesn't really know the rules) should be punished with kicks; malicious or concealed offenses should be punished more harshly.
			Ask other staff if you need help making a decision.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the case of apparent child pornography <em>(actual photographic images or video of underage humans engaged in sex, not lolicon or nudism)</em>, contact the owner for directions.
		</p>

		<h3 class="text-center">Ban Appeals</h3>
		<p>
			Except in extreme cases (doxxing, ddosing, etc.), if a user is banned for their first offense, and they create a reasonable appeal, the ban should be removed.
			It takes a decent amount of work to make a ban appeal. There is no reason to be overly punitive.
		</p>

	<h3 class="text-center">The Movie Theater</h3>
	<p>The Movie Theater is a protected, staff-controllable theater meant for events. Do not post pornography or abuse the theater commands.</p>

	<h3 class="text-center">Movie Nights</h3>
	<p>Any staff member can host <strong>movie nights</strong>. To do so, request a video in the Movie Theater and then say <em>!movienight &lt;title of movie&gt;</em> in chat. This will make a server-wide announcement and lock the Movie Theater queue, and your video will play after a 5 minute timer.</p>

	<h3 class="text-center">Requirements</h3>
	<p>At a minimum, please be active on a weekly basis. If you disappear for a few weeks without notice, you will be demoted.</p>
